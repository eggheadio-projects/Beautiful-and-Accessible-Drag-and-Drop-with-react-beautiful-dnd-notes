# My Take

This course is a bit old by a couple years, and is still very relevant. I only ran into one small deprecation in lesson 4 and I listed more documentation there about it. `innerRef` being changed to `ref`. 

I highly recommend making a commit after each lesson because at the start of some lessons, we will disregard everything done in the previous lesson and you will have to try to figure out where to start your code at. Making these commits will save you a good bit of time. 

I really enjoyed taking this course. It was a lot of fun learning all the different aspects that the instructor taught. I haven't taken a course like this and learning about an app that I can drag and drop and reorder things was a lot of fun. # Beautiful-and-Accessible-Drag-and-Drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd-notes

## Description

Drag and drop (dnd) experiences are often built to sort lists of content vertically and horizontally.

react-beautiful-dnd is an excellent tool for these use cases. It utilizes the render props pattern to build accessible dnd functionality into lists that look and behave as you would expect—and you’ll even get keyboard-accessible dnd, straight out of the box, with no extra work required. It’s actually easy to start using, and this course is a great place to start.

We will create a highly interactive task management application from scratch using the building blocks of react-beautiful-dnd. Over 14 lessons, you will get practice in:

building droppable containers to sort draggable items horizontally and vertically
moving items between columns
and even moving the columns themselves
Following the course, you’ll be ready to build powerful dnd experiences into your own projects.
