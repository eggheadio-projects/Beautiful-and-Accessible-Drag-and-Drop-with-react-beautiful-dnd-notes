# [Beautiful and Accessible Drag and Drop with react-beautiful-dnd](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)

This course is a bit old, a couple years I think, and is still very relevant. I only ran into one small deprecation in lesson 4 and I listed more documentation there about it. `innerRef` being changed to `ref`. 

I highly recommend making a commit after each lesson because at the start of some lessons, we will disregard everything done in the previous lesson and you will have to try to figure out where to start your code at. Making these commits will save you a good bit of time. 

I really enjoyed taking this course. It was a lot of fun learning all the different aspects that the instructor taught. I haven't taken a course like this and learning about an app that I can drag and drop and reorder things was a lot of fun. # Beautiful-and-Accessible-Drag-and-Drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd-notes
